          <p class="fragment">The current generation has grown up with computers.</p>

          or does the system need to adapt to the kids?"</p>

            <p>Teaching is done in an environment and a way which is quite different from the way the current generation interacts with the world.</p>
            <p>Conservative approach to education.</p>
            <p>Why should we assume children should have to change to meet the needs of (possibly outdated) education?</p>
