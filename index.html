            <h2>Academic Analysis</h2>

            <p class="fragment">Zorn et al. (n.d.): using Minecraft as a tool to teach programming increases interest in the subject</p>

            <h2>Conclusion (1)</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Research shows that many different games are used in teaching all kinds of subjects, mostly with positive results</p>
            <p class="fragment">
              Use of gaming in teaching produces results on different cognitive levels<br />

            <p class="fragment">Distinct from other games used in education, Minecraft offers extensive modding support</p>
